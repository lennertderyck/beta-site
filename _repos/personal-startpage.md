Clone my project and set it up with Github-pages.

Edit the shortcuts and themes as you like. After that you can set your personal startpage as standard page when you open a new window or even as homepage. If you use Chrome you can use the New Tab Direct plugin to show your personal startpage when you open a new tab.

Make sure that you only enabled the last option in the settings of the extension.
